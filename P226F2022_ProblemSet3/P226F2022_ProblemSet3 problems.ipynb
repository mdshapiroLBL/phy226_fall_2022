We will describe our detector as an $x$-$y$ plane segmented into strips, each of width $\\ell$ in the $y$-direction. When a track moving in the $z$-direction passes through the plane, it deposits energy in the detector and that energy is collected using charge sensitive ampliﬁers (one per strip). You many assume that the incident track is normal to the silicon plane. Looking down on the strip detector (so that the incident tracks are traveling into the page), the detector looks like this:"
